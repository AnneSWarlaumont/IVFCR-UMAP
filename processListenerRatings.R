# Plan:
# Go through the relabelCHN assignments and identify the relabelings that are
# finished and can be kept and discard those that ar in-progress
# While at it, create a master list of files to be included, together with some
# metadata for each
# Get the modal rating for each LENA segment
# Perhaps do this using only first pass or using 2nd pass if available
# Computer inter-rater and intra-rater reliability
# Get clean lists of the subset of clips that are clean as defined by Pagliarini
# et al. (2022)
